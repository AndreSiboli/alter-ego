          <p>The short answer is no, but let&apos;s dive deeper.</p>

          <p>
            Humans often seek motivation from people or things around them. An
            alter ego is no different, it&apos;s a second version of yourself. It can
            emerge from a situation or experience that forces you to reflect on
            who you are. In fiction, many characters have an alter ego. But this
            doesn&apos;t happen only in fiction, real people also experience this
            need. So, if your second self doesn&apos;t hurt you or anyone else, it&apos;s
            completely normal. Having an alter ego based on a character from an
            anime, movie, or even a real person can be a way to build your own
            identity. For example: Guts from Berserk.
          </p>

          <p>
            Guts was a warrior forged in blood, finding purpose with the Band of
            the Hawkâ€”until his closest friend, Griffith, betrayed them in the
            Eclipse, sacrificing their comrades and violating Casca, Guts&apos;
            beloved. Crushed by loss and consumed by rage, Guts became the Black
            Swordsman, hunting demons in a spiral of vengeance. But through new
            allies and the will to protect, he slowly rises from the darkness,
            choosing redemption over revenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            A regular person who was once blinded by their own anger can come to
            see it as a way to grow. There are many examples of this, like
            Thorfinn from Vinland Saga or David from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.
            It&apos;s a path toward becoming a better version of yourself.
